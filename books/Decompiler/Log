There are several very good books on the market about the JVM. The best is Bill
Venners’ Inside the Java 2 Virtual Machine (McGraw-Hill, 2000). Some of the
book’s chapters are available online at www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/. If you
can’t find the book, then check out Venners’ equally excellent ‘‘Under the Hood’’

articles on JavaWorld.com. This series of articles was the original material that
he later expanded into the book. Sun’s Java Virtual Machine Specification, 2nd
edition (Addison-Wesley, 1999), written by Tim Lindholm and Frank Yellin, is
both comprehensive and very informative for would-be decompiler writers. But
being a specification, it isn’t what you would call a good read. This book is also
available online at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec.
