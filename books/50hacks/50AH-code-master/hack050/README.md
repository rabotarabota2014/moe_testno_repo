Using Jenkins with Android projects
===================================

This project contains a simple Android application, and a basic test suite for that application.
Also available is a [sample Jenkins installation][1] (zip), ready for use, which will download the sample application, compile it, and test it on various Android emulators, as described in the book.

The application contains a couple of deliberate mistakes to illustrate how using Jenkins to automatically test multiple device configurations can detect mistakes which may not normally be caught when testing on a single device or emulator.
